# React Todo List

## Project Overview

This is a **Todo List** application built using **React**. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with data persistence enabled through localStorage. The project is designed to explore core React concepts such as JSX, state management, breaking down the UI into reusable components, and the use of hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

## Demo

A brief demo is included, showcasing the main functionality of the React Todo List app. It highlights adding, completing, and deleting todos, along with the persistent data even after the page reload.

## Features

- **Add a Todo**: Users can input a new task, and it will be displayed in the list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete a Todo**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent State**: Todos are saved in localStorage so that the list is preserved even after the browser is refreshed.
- **Component-based structure**: The app is broken down into separate components for better maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built using React functional components.
- **React Hooks**: `useState` for state management, `useEffect` for side effects (saving todos to localStorage).
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the UI.
- **localStorage**: To persist the todos across page reloads.

## Why I Built This Project

The primary goal of this project was to dive deeper into **React** and its ecosystem. Through building this Todo List, I focused on learning:

- **React thinking**: How to break down UI into components.
- **JSX**: Writing React's declarative syntax for rendering UI.
- **State management**: Using `useState` to manage the application's state.
- **Lifecycle management**: Leveraging `useEffect` to synchronize state with localStorage.

The Todo List is a perfect beginner project to grasp these core concepts and start developing in React with a focus on reusability, modularity, and component-driven architecture.
